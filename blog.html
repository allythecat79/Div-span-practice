    <h3>Yarn</h3>

    <div class="unimportant">
    <p>First you need yarn.  A lot of people start with a washcloth as their first project.  For a washcloth you need an inexpensive cotton yarn.  As your projects get more varied, you'll want different types of yarn.</p>

    <p>Here are a few yarns to start with.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="important">
    <ol>
      <li>Wool yarn</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Fine wool</li>
          <li>Medium wool</li>
          <li>Long wool</li>
          <li>Double wool</li>
        </ul>

      <li>Cashmere yarn</li>

    <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

    <div class="unimportant">
    <p>I hope you enjoy going to your local yarn shop and picking out some yarn for your first project.  Feel it and smell it to get an idea of what it would be like to knit with it.  Even the simplist projects look wonderful when knit with beautiful yarn.  If it takes a while to feel like you know what you're doing, just remember that everyone goes through that!</p>
